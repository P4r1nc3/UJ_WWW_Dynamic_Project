# About the Project

The project is a very simple website used for "managing the fridge". With its help, we can control what food products are in our fridge, when they expire, and more.

# Preparing for the First Launch

### Requirements

To run the project, it is necessary to have `Node.js` and `mysql` installed.

### Database

To ensure the proper functioning of the project, it is necessary to create a database named `freedgedb`. It may be necessary to enter a password for the root mysql user inside `/backend/config/config.json`. Creating tables within the created database is not required, as the program will do it for us.

### Backend
Next, navigate to the `/backend` directory and install the required packages using the command:

```bash
npm install
```

After installing the packages, use the command:

```bash
npm start
```

### Frontend

In a similar way, you should proceed in the `/frontend` directory. To install the required packages, use the command:

```bash
npm install
```

After installing the packages, use the command:

```bash
npm start
```
